# Data Preprocessing and Machine Learning

## Feature creator
For this ocation i reuse the recording system of my Noise Recognition Project for recording during a day all the features of my house, this is going to be the most important feature because it needs to learn about people reactions and house environments thats when usually the people past a hard time. 

 It is important to say that this is not a permanent solution because i need to find other system to recognise data, This model to learn correctly it needs to be trained all days, so its a reinforcment learning model what i am seeking for.
